"""
This module consists of a wrapper that handles communication with the RC car. 

See also
    :py:class:`rcracers.comms.serial_comm.Transmitter`, 
    :py:class:`rcracers.comms.serial_comm.MsgStruct`

Example
    >>> with Racer('COM5', sample_period=0.01) as racer:
    >>>     for i in range(1000):
    >>>         racer.apply(drive=0.25, steer=0.5)

    This creates a racer context with a sample period of 0.01. 
    We can apply a drive input between -1 and 1 and a 
    steer input between -1 and 1.

.. warning::
    Note that, when a sample period is set, the apply method
    will block until the sample period has passed, before
    actually applying the input.
