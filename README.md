# Model Predictive Control

## Overview
This project contains six python files, one per each of the six sessions of the Model Predictive Control course. Each of these files has been written to answer the questions in the assignment. The files are:
- 'Session1.py': LQR and Dynamic Programming.
- 'Session2.py': Linear MPC and Convex Optimization.
- 'Session3.py': MPC theory: terminal ingredients. 
- 'Session4.py': Nonlinear MPC. 
- 'Session5.py': State estimation. 
- 'Session6.py': Optimization.

In each of these files, at the end, is present a 'main' function that runs the different points of each assignment. The code is written in Python 3.10.10.

Additionally, two folders are present: the '.venv' folder to store the virtual environment used to run the code, the 'given' folder containing the given files for the assignment.
